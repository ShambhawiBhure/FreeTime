This is a multi-game web application for kids to pass their time while getting to learn some basic things.
Run on computer/laptop
It includes three games :
<ul>
  <li>Dice Game</li>
  <li>Drum Kit</li>
  <li>Simon Game</li>
 </ul>
 <strong>Dice Game : </strong>Every time you refresh the page, a pair of dice will show different outcomes, and based on that it will state which dice shows greater number and hence declares it as the winner. In case both the dice show the same number, it is a tie/draw!!
 <hr>
 <strong>Drum Kit : </strong>This is truely just a leisure activity, wherein there are some set of musical instruments, and the user can click on any of them to hear them!
 <hr>
 <strong>Simon Game : </strong>This game is what I personally enjoyed making and playing too! :) <br> This is a sort of memory game where once you go to the game, you need to click any button from your keyboard and then one out of the four coloured boxes will blink and a sound will be generated. You need to click that particular box once and keep it in mind, after this some another box will blink and make sound, now here comes the real game!! What you have to do is that you first need to click on the box which was blinked at the start of the game, and then click on the box which had blinked this time...And just like this everytime, you have to start from the very first box and keep going!! If you forget and blink on the wrong box..boomm..you loose the game..and start back from Level 0...
 <h4>Happy Playing!!</h4>
